# ML-PlantDisease
This jupyter notebook is processing image about plant disease. Using CNN Model Baseline and build 22 layers with (227, 227, 3) input shape and 15 output shape which is represent 15 classes.

## DOCUMENTATION
### Machine Learning
1. Download dataset in [Plant Village Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/emmarex/plantdisease)
2. Extract the dataset
3. Create python notebook to process the dataset
4. Load the dataset and devide them into training set and test set
5. In this project we use CNN Model Baseline. So create some neural network layer before training the data
6. Wait and check the accuracy in every epoch
7. Save the data in Keras Model (*.h5)
8. Convert the Keras Model into Tensorflow lite model (*.tflite)
